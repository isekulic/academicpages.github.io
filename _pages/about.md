Research and engineering interests:
- Efficient and scalable production-ready LLMs;
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG);
- Dense retrieval;
- User simulation for dialog systems.

I work at the intersection of NLP and IR, focusing on conversational search, task-oriented dialog systems, document retrieval, and generative AI. I leverage state-of-the-art methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dense retrieval, performance-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and in-context learning of LLMs. I thrive in team work and lead projects from ideation to deployment.

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from USI, IDSIA in Lugano, Switzerland, where I conducted research on conversational AI under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Crestani.
My research was centered on mixed-initiative conversational search. Specifically, I focused on methods for generating clarifying questions with an aim to elucidate user's information need, as well as on LLM-based user simulation for improved conversational search evaluation.

I published in mulple top-tier NLP and IR venues, such as SIGIR, ACL, WSDM, TIST, ECIR, COLING (700+ citations, h-index 10). For a full list, please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jxKS_4EAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
I serve, or have served, as program committee member for: SIGIR, WSDM, ECIR, CIKM, EACL.
