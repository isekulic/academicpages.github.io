**Looking for work: I'm open for opportunities as Applied Scientist, Research Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in NLP and IR.**

I work at the intersection of **natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR)**, focusing on conversational search, task-oriented dialog systems, document retrieval, and generative AI. I leverage state-of-the-art methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dense retrieval, performance-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and in-context learning of LLMs. I thrive in team work and lead projects from ideation to deployment.

I hold a **Ph.D. degree** in Computer Science from USI, IDSIA in Lugano, Switzerland, where I conducted research on **conversational AI** under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Crestani.
My research was centered on mixed-initiative conversational search. Specifically, I focused on methods for generating clarifying questions with an aim to elucidate user's information need, as well as on LLM-based user simulation for improved conversational search evaluation.

I published in mulple top-tier NLP and IR venues, such as SIGIR, ACL, WSDM, TIST, ECIR, COLING (700+ citations, h-index 10). For a full list, please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jxKS_4EAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
I serve, or have served, as a program committee member for: SIGIR, WSDM, ECIR, CIKM, EACL.

## Research Interests
I'm interested in several research areas, related to NLP, IR, and LLMs:
* **Evaluation of dialog systems** -- focusing on complexity of user goals, context understanding, and the number of possible conversational paths to reach a goal.
* **LLM-centric user simulation and sythetic data generation** -- as one of the potential solutions to above issue of evaluation.
* **Information retrieval (dense, hybrid)** -- long texts, products, and multi-modal data;
* **Answering complex information needs** -- conversational search and retrieval-augmented generation.

## Machine Learning Engineering Interests
As a research engineer, I'm interested in deploying ML- and LLM-based solutions to real-world problems.
These include:
* **Efficient and scalable production-ready LLMs** -- performance-efficient task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs and their efficient deployment to local stack;
* **Agent-centric LLM-based task-oriented dialog systems** -- modelling policy and decision-making through LLM agents;
* **Dense retrieval beyond simple vector embeddings** -- data-specific embeddings via fine-tuning appropriate models;
* **Tackling tasks with traditional ML pipelines** -- not all tasks require costly LLM-based solutions;
* **Data analysis and cleanup** -- focused on understanding the challenge we're tackling and avoiding "garbage in, garbage out" phenomena.
